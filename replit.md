## Features
- 📦 Package tracking management
- 🔐 Telegram Web App authentication
- 📊 Status tracking and history
- 📧 Email notifications via Resend
- 🚚 Route generation and delivery estimation
- 📱 Mobile-optimized interface

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Flask 3.0.0, Python 3.11
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via DATABASE_URL)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, CSS3
- **Authentication**: Telegram Web App API
- **Deployment**: Gunicorn (production)

## Environment Variables

### Required
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `BOT_TOKEN` - Telegram bot token from @BotFather
- `OWNER_TELEGRAM_ID` - Telegram user ID of the owner

### Optional
- `CHANNEL_ID` - Telegram channel ID for notifications
- `ADMIN_TOKEN` - Secret key for sessions (auto-generated if not set)
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - API key for email service

## Database
The application uses PostgreSQL with the following tables:

### Tracking Tables
- `trackings` - Main tracking records
- `shipping_routes` - Predefined routes and delivery estimates
- `status_history` - Tracking status change history

### Social/Marketplace Tables
- `users` - User profiles (extended with social fields: level, credits, bio, etc.)
- `posts` - User publications (images, videos, text)
- `follows` - Follower/following relationships
- `products` - Marketplace listings
- `user_bots` - User's active bots
- `achievements` - User badges and achievements
- `achievement_types` - Available achievement definitions
- `wallet_transactions` - Credit transactions history
- `shared_posts` - Reposted/shared content
- `post_likes` - Like tracking for posts

Database is initialized automatically on first run via `init_db.py`.

## Development

### Running Locally
The application runs on `0.0.0.0:5000` with cache control headers disabled for development.

```bash
python run.py
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Initialize/reset database
python init_db.py
```

## Deployment
Configured for Replit deployment with:
- Frontend on port 5000 (webview)
- Cache control headers for iframe compatibility
- Production-ready Gunicorn setup
