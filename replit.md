# BUNK3R - Telegram Package Tracking System

## Overview
BUNK3R is a Telegram Web App designed for comprehensive package tracking and shipment management. It provides a mobile-optimized, secure, and user-friendly experience for logistics, integrating an internal monetary system (BUNK3RCO1N) and social features, all authenticated via Telegram. The project aims to offer a robust solution for package management, notifications, and community engagement, leveraging the TON blockchain for its monetary system. The business vision includes market potential in the logistics and crypto sectors, with ambitions to become a leading platform for package tracking with integrated Web3 functionalities.

## User Preferences
- Language: Spanish (es)
- Framework: Flask + Vanilla JS
- Database: PostgreSQL
- UI Style: Neo-bank dark theme with Binance-style gold (#F0B90B) accents
- Design Reference: Binance/Revolut/N26 - professional, minimalist, no emojis (use SVG icons)

## System Architecture
The application features a Flask (Python) backend, a PostgreSQL database, and a vanilla JavaScript frontend. Telegram Web App API handles authentication. The UI/UX is mobile-optimized with an Instagram-inspired dark theme, a bottom navigation bar, a slide-up profile modal, and a sidebar menu.

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- Neo-bank dark theme with ultra-dark backgrounds (#0B0E11, #12161C, #1E2329) and gold accents (#F0B90B, #FCD535).
- Bottom navigation with SVG icons (Home, Marketplace, Wallet, Profile).
- Story rings, preload screens, primary buttons, toasts, loaders, and modals all use the gold theme.
- Sidebar elements use Lucide SVG icons instead of emojis.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic interactions, CSS3 for styling, focusing on accessibility. Includes dynamic screen navigation, infinite scroll, pagination, and optimized media uploads.
- **Backend:** Flask for routing, APIs, business logic, with input validation, rate limiting, error handling, and production logging.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with a comprehensive schema.
- **Deployment:** Optimized for Replit with Gunicorn, including cache control headers.
- **State Management:** Centralized client-side state management using a StateManager module with event-based pub/sub.
- **Request Management:** Robust API request handling with configurable timeouts, automatic retries with exponential backoff, and cancellation.
- **Performance:** Database connection pooling, memory leak prevention, and skeleton loaders.
- **Security:** Rate limiting on critical endpoints, robust TON address validation, mandatory ADMIN_TOKEN in production, consistent XSS prevention via `html.escape()`, CSRF protection with `Origin/Referer` checks, and security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy, HSTS).
- **BUNK3RCO1N (B3C) Integration:** Dedicated service layer for TON blockchain interaction, real-time pricing via STON.fi DEX API, TON/USD conversion via CoinGecko, and buy/sell/withdraw/deposit functionalities. The current implementation uses a fixed price for B3C (0.10 USD) without a DEX pool, where purchases are made with TON to the owner's wallet and B3C is issued, and sales/withdrawals involve returning B3C for TON (minus commission).
- **Unique Wallets for Purchases:** A system generates unique, temporary TON wallets for each purchase using `tonsdk`, encrypting mnemonic phrases with AES-256-CBC. These wallets expire if unused and consolidate funds to a hot wallet upon successful deposit verification.

**Feature Specifications:**
- **Package Tracking:** Management of tracking records, status history, and delivery estimations.
- **Telegram Integration:** Authentication, notifications, and owner-specific access controls.
- **Security System:** Multi-point security for wallet and device management (trusted devices, 2FA, lockout, activity logs).
- **Monetary System (BUNK3RCO1N):** Internal currency for in-app purchases, secured by TON payment verification and TonCenter API. Features include auto-registration of wallets, address validation, transaction history, and a debit system.
- **Social Features:** User profiles, posts, likes, follows, avatar uploads, and AES-256-GCM encrypted media publications via Cloudinary.
- **Marketplace:** Sections for products and dynamic bot management.
- **Admin Panel:** Comprehensive logging and auditing system for admin and security actions with filtering, pagination, and export capabilities. Content moderation endpoints for posts, stories, and hashtags.
